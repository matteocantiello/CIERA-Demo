<div>\label{tab:table} Properties of IGW AM transport during evolutionary stages corresponding to the stellar models. Here, $r_c$ is the radius at the base of the convection zone in consideration, $T_{\rm shell}$ is the duration of the burning phase, $t_{\rm waves}$ is a wave spin-up timescale , and $\omega_{\rm c}$ is the angular convective turnover frequency. For He and C burning phases, IGW may be able to spin down the core, and $P_{\rm min}$ is the approximate minimum rotation period set by IGW during each phase. $P_{\rm min,Fe}$ is the minimum rotation period if AM is conserved until just before CC (when the iron core has a radius of 1500 km), and $P_{\rm min,NS}$ is the minimum rotation period if AM is conserved until NS birth. The listed values of $P_{\rm min}$ can only be achieved if IGW are able to extract sufficient AM from the core (see text), which is unlikely to occur during O/Si shell burning. <br></div>
